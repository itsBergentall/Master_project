# Master_project

# new_datacreator 
- Loads data (defect-matrices and eq_classes) from Karl Hammars MCMC-script and modify so that i can create edgelist, node features etc. 
The files eq_distr and defect_matrices contains 100 graphs (?) right now.  

# convert_data_pytorch 
- Loads our data from new_datacreator and makes it to usable tensors/graphs in pytorch_geometric. There are also the collab-notebook network at the bottom
